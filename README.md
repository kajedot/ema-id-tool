# ema-id-tool

## What is this program for?
This program provides utilities for checksum calculation and validation of the OCHP Contract-ID (EMA-ID).

Calculation algorithms are ported from the [EV-ID-Validator](https://www.ochp.eu/id-validator/) by OCHP.
Country codes are checked based on the [python-iso3166](https://github.com/deactivated/python-iso3166) module by Mike Spindel.
